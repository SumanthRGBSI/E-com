Commerce OS - Unified Platform
üìñ Description
Commerce OS is a comprehensive, single-page web application designed to simulate a unified e-commerce platform for both Buyers and Vendors. It provides distinct interfaces and functionalities tailored to each user role, all managed within a single HTML file using client-side JavaScript. The application uses mock data to simulate a real-world e-commerce environment, including products, orders, and user profiles.

The interface is fully responsive, offering a seamless experience on both desktop and mobile devices.

‚ú® Key Features
The application is split into two main roles, each with its own set of features:

üë§ Buyer View
Product Browsing: Buyers can view a list of available products, filter them by category, and see details like price, rating, and availability.

Shopping Cart: A fully functional cart where buyers can add products, update quantities, or remove items. The cart dynamically calculates the subtotal, taxes, and total.

Checkout Process: A multi-step modal for checkout that includes selecting a shipping address, choosing a payment method, and confirming the order.

Order History & Tracking: Buyers can view their past orders and track the current status of an order through a visual timeline.

üíº Vendor View
Dashboard: An analytical dashboard that displays key metrics like total sales, total orders, and the number of listed products. It also includes a sales analytics chart and a list of recent orders.

Product Management: Vendors can view their product catalog, add new products, edit existing ones, and toggle product availability.

Order Management: Vendors can view and manage incoming orders, with the ability to update the order status (e.g., from "Processing" to "Shipped").

Inventory Overview: A dedicated section to monitor product stock levels. It highlights products that are low on stock and allows vendors to initiate a reorder.

Purchase Order (PO) System: Vendors can create and manage purchase orders to replenish stock from suppliers.

üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used
HTML5: The core structure of the web application.

Tailwind CSS: For all styling and creating a modern, responsive user interface.

JavaScript (ES6+): Handles all the application logic, state management, dynamic rendering of content, and user interactions.

Chart.js: Used to render the sales analytics chart on the vendor dashboard.

Lucide Icons: Provides modern and clean icons used throughout the application.

Google Fonts (Inter): For a clean and readable typography.

üöÄ How to Use
Open the File: Simply open the new 9.html file in any modern web browser.

Choose a Role: On the login screen, select either "Login as Buyer" or "Login as Vendor" to enter the respective application view.

Explore:

As a Buyer, you can browse products, add them to your cart, and simulate the checkout process.

As a Vendor, you can explore the dashboard, manage products, and update order statuses.

Switch Roles: To switch between roles, click the "Logout" button, which will return you to the initial login screen.

All data is stored in a mock JavaScript object within the file, so any changes will be reset upon reloading the page.
